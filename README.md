3D pong is a pong game that implemented by using BabylonJS.

  - Just a pong with 3D style.

### Tech

3D Pong uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [BabylonJS] - Babylon.js brings powerful, beautiful, simple, and open 3D to everyone on the web.


And of course I used Typescript for implementation for practice.
